This is a .ipynb Google Colab project.
The dataset is AI-generated with custom constraints.
Custom input from user is asked as in real-time it will be sensor generated.
To Turn on the street lights is predicted as Yes/No?
The ambient street lights (in %) is also predicted.
Random Forest Classifier & Regressor is used after detailed comparison with other ML Models.
Negligible MSE & Almost 100% accuracy is produced.
This project will further be implemented on an industry-level with real-time data and implementation.
